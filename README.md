The potential and scope of the application of decentralized protocols have already become so much broader.

Q2.what is the core problem blockchain trying to solve?
Ans-Blockchain Addresses the Problem of Data Security and Trust by Making the Ledger Public. 
Hardware and software errors are not the only data securityissue. 
The blockchain has to also protect itself from willful fraud and theft.
Two blockchain design features help in this effort.

Q3.what are the few features that blockchain will give you?
Ans-Basic Features of Blockchain Technology
Cannot be Corrupted. There are some exciting blockchain features but among them “Immutability” is undoubtedly one of the key features of blockchain technology.
1. Decentralized Technology
2.Enhanced Security
3.Distributed Ledgers.
4.Consensus.
5.Faster Settlement.

Q4.what all things does a bolck contain?
Ans-Each block contains, among other things, the current time, a record of some or all recent transactions,

To explain this in simple words, suppose a person sends a sum of money, then the receiver will get to know that the sender is linked to a bitcoin address but will not know the actual address.  
Hence, we say that bitcoin or any other alt currencies are not entirely anonymous.
 There are various reasons for keeping everything hidden, the primary ones include :

To explain this in simple words, I can say that blockchain.info in its system keeps on chaining the address for a given wallet. 
This discourages the ability to trace payments done to a particular wallet. Some of the other platforms like Private Instant Verified Transaction (PIVX) makes use of the mixing mechanism to attain
